## What I've Learned

I recently took a full-stack web development course on YouTube that covered ReactJS, NodeJS, Express, and MySQL. I learned a lot from this course and I wanted to take some time to reflect on what I learned. Here's a list of the key things I gained from this course:

- Learn sequelize to make model for mysql database
- Learn using router in sequelize for CRUD on the back-end
- Learn authentication from back-end to have a middleware on auth-needed router
- Learn hashing password with bcrypt hash and bcrypt compare
- Review React library for front-end
- Learn useEffect and useContext
- Learn authentication in front-end with data saved on localStorage
- Learn about formik for form and yup for validation

### Sequelize

I learned how to use Sequelize, a NodeJS ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library, to connect to and interact with a MySQL database. With Sequelize, I was able to define my database models and perform CRUD operations with ease.

### Routers & Authentication

I gained a deeper understanding of how to handle routing and authentication in a full-stack web application. I learned how to create middleware in Express to protect routes that require authentication and how to implement authentication both on the back-end and front-end.

### Hashing Passwords

I learned about the importance of securely storing user passwords in a database and how to use bcrypt to hash passwords before storing them. I also learned how to compare hashed passwords during authentication to ensure the security of user data.

### ReactJS

I reviewed ReactJS and learned about features such as useEffect and useContext. I gained a better understanding of how ReactJS works and how to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

### Forms & Validation

I learned about formik, a library for handling forms in React, and yup, a library for form validation. I gained hands-on experience building forms and implementing validation to ensure the accuracy and completeness of user input.

Overall, I feel like I've gained a solid foundation in full-stack web development and I'm excited to continue learning and building more web applications.
